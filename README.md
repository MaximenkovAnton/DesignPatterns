# DesignPatterns
That project was made **just as a tutorial**. You can use it to improve your knowledge, to refresh it, 
or even just to copy-paste, if you don't want to write something by your on. 

* **You can use** the material however you want, including educational, personal and commercial proposes.
* **You are able** to modify that code whenever you like. 
* **You are not forced** to inform me or to put a reference anywhere in your work 
(_even if you just copied the material without any changing_), if you would like to use it.

But I will be really glad, if you will tell me about it, give me a link, put the reference, or just send me a `"thank you"` message.

# Notice
The structure, that are used in the project is terrible. 
The main reason for that is that I don't want to bother me (or you, if you will make a clone of the repo)
with lots of public classes, or hundreds of different projects in one.place. 
I really hope it wouldn't be a problem for you to make a better structure, if you will use it in your projects.
